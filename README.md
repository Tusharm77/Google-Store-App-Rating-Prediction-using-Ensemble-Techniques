# Google-Store-App-Rating-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Techniques

Problem Statement : The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. However, many apps are being developed every single day and only a few of them become profitable. It is important for developers to be able to predict the success of their app and incorporate features that make an app successful.
We can collect app data and user ratings from the app stores and use it to extract insightful information.
A machine learning model can be used to predict a rating for a given app, which can be used to estimate success and scope of improvement. Actionable insights learned through such analysis can be used by developers to make a successful app and capture the Android market.

Objective
To predict the rating for a mobile app given features like size, number of downloads, etc.

Approach:
Performed basic EDA on data and pre-processing to clean data and encoded categorical variables. Built a classifer model using Decision Tree, Random forest, Gradient boosting and a Stacking model to predict rating category(High vs Low). Analysed importance of various features drew inferences on what makes a APP highly rated on play store.
